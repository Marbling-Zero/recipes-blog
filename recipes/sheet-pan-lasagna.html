    <h1>Sheet Pan Lasagna</h1>
    <p>This sheet pan lasagna saves the effort of layering and offers up more crispy edges, which we all know is the best part of lasagna. With sausage and a spinach-ricotta mixture, and cheese atop all, it's a fun way to make an old favorite.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (5 ounce) container fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound spicy sausage, casings removed</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 pound lasagna, broken into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>4 cups marinara sauce such as Rao's®</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 12x17-inch baking sheet with 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil for a thin, crisp sheet-pan version, or use a 9x13-inch baking dish for a cozier, “pasta bake” feel.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add spinach and salt; cook, stirring, until wilted, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer spinach to a bowl. Use kitchen shears to roughly chop, then stir in ricotta cheese. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Wipe out the frying pan with a paper towel. Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and sausage. Cook undisturbed for 1 to 2 minutes to get some browning, then break sausage apart with a spatula. Continue cooking until browned throughout, about 5 minutes. Add red onion and sauté until softened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add lasagna sheets and cook for 4 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Drain and return to the pot. If you aren't immediately mixing with the sauce mixture (next step), toss pasta in a drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Stir marinara sauce into sausage mixture. Pour sausage and sauce into the pot with pasta. Add 1 1/2 cups mozzarella and 1 cup Parmesan, stirring until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Spread pasta mixture evenly on the prepared baking sheet or in the baking dish. Sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Spoon or dollop the spinach-ricotta mixture across the surface.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until cheese is golden, sauce is bubbling, and edges are lightly crisped, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with extra marinara sauce and a sprinkle of cheese, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
